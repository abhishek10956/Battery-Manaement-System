# Li-ion Battery Management System

 - Designed and simulated using of Li-ion Battery Management System (BMS) for Electric Vehicles using MATLAB Simulink under different parameters i.e., Cell voltage, current, temperature. 
 - Performed Passive cell balancing using resistors considering SoH and SoC of the Battery Pack.
 - Simulated and analysed running data in graphical form to improve the performance of BMS.
 - Made a report to enhance the performance of battery pack using BMS.
