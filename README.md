# Li-ion Battery Management System

 - Designed and simulated using of Li-ion Battery Management System (BMS) for Electric Vehicles using MATLAB Simulink under different parameters i.e., Cell voltage, current, temperature. 
 - Performed Passive cell balancing using resistors considering SoH and SoC of the Battery Pack.
 - Simulated and analysed running data in graphical form to improve the performance of BMS.
 - Made a report to enhance the performance of battery pack using BMS.
## Deployment

To deploy this project

```bash
1. Install MATLAB software.
2. Your college/company may already provide access to MATLAB, Simulink, and add-on products through a campus-wide license.
3. Otherwise, go to the link, https://in.mathworks.com/store/link/products/student/SV?s_tid=ac_buy_sv_but1  to buy license and install the software.
4. Clone this project.
5. Or go to Simulink > New project from source code > git > retrieve.  
6. Go to the MATLAB > Home > Simulink > Open file location > Run and run these simulations.
